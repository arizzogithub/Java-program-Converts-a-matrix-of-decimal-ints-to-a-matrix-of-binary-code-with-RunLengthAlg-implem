TASK: 
Develop a Java prototype program to help you explore differences in compression performances.

I. Develop a program that converts a matrix of decimal integers to a matrix of binary code (codewords) and to a matrix of Gray code.
The input and output of your program should be read from and sent to a text file, namely input.txt and output.txt, respectively. The program should be able to read at least the following data as the input:

(a) A one dimensional array of integers (decimal values ranging from 0 to 255, i.e. [0,255], inclusive 0 and 255)

(b) Two dimensional array of integers [0,255]

(c) Three dimensional array of integers [0,255].

The output of the program should contain the following:

(a) A one dimensional array of binary codewords and their Gray codes

(b) Two dimensional array of binary codewords and their Gray codes

(c) Three dimensional array of binary codewords and their Gray codes.

II. You should apply ONE of the lossless compression algorithms below to the sources of the binary and Gray code:

(1) Run-length

(2) Huffman coding

(3) Shannon-Fano coding

(4) Arithmetic coding

(5) Dictionary compression

III. Your program should report statistics of changes in the process. The compression efficiency should also be reported using the analytical techniques learnt from the course. 
While being encouraged to design good user interfaces, you are welcome to use essential user interfaces, such as tables (or diagrams).
